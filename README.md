Educating People of the effect and prevention of malaria.

This simple game is a clone from Duck Hunt, designed to educate the world about the effect of malaria on millions of lives. It is also a platform for raising funds to fight malaria in Africa.

Built by nanap (Nana) and Klyph (Clifford) from Mattew Surabian's Duck Hunk code ... Thanks for sharing ....
